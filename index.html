                <p> Hi my name is Jarret. Currently a student participating in the UT Austin coding bootcamp, I have spent most of my time prior to this endeavor learning a smattering of skills and developing more passions that one human can possibly follow. I play music, I write, I game, I design, I cook, and I'll leave it at that for now.</p>
                
                <p>Currently my hope is to enter the the tech industry through Web Dev as a starting place, and hopefully translate these skills to game design, and making board games web accessible.</p>

                <p> If you feel like you would enjoy to hear me ramble about anything related to almost anything under sun, feel free to contact me via email. I am friendly, I hope :)</p>
